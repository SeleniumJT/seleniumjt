SeleniumJT
==========
SeleniumJT is a Selenium2 wrapper framework that simplifies the coding required for getting you tests up and running fast. 
In addition to encapsulating the idiosyncrasies of Selenium WebDriver it also supplies a more reliable testing framework 
for dynamic web pages by allowing elements time for conditions to be met before failure, times that are fully customisable.
